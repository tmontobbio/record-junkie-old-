          ðŸŽ§ Record Junkie is a way to bring your analog life into the digital
          world. Any serious vinyl collector knows how difficult it is to keep
          track of all of your prized records. With Record Junkie, you can drink
          baja blast 'til the cows come home! ...what? Anyway, update your
          online collection with ease and make comments about what you're never
          selling and what you're willing to part ways with or trade.

          Ok... so you're a rich vinyl nerd and we're very, very broke from
          attending Flatiron School. Find us on Venmo @RecordJunkie and give us
          all yr money! You'll be glad you did! One day when we're big shot web
          developers, we will remember that time you gave us money, and do
          nothing... Cheers!
